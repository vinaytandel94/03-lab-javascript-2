# A simple introduction to JavaScript and Local Storage

You can [view this page here](https://ctec3905.github.io/03-lab-javascript-2/).If you have GIT available, *clone* this repository using `git clone https://github.com/CTEC3905/03-lab-javascript-2.git` instead of just downloading it.

You must then create *your own repository on GitHub* for these files, then change the GIT remote to the GitHub URL for your new repository with the following commands:

- `git remote rm origin`
- `git remote add origin [YOUR_REPO_URL_HERE]`

then check your remote is your own repository with:

- `git remote -v`

This exercise builds on JavaScript 01 by using localstorage to retain some data between sessions, so the data remains stored in the browser after users close the browser window.
