# A simple introduction to JavaScript and Local Storage

*Clone* this repository using `git clone https://github.com/CTEC3905/javascript_02_localstorage` instead of just downloading it. Before you push, you will need to change the GIT remote to your own repository for this code with the following command: `git remote set-url origin [YOUR_REPO_URL_HERE]`.

This exercise builds on JavaScript 01 by using localstorage to retain some data between sessions, so you can close the browser window and the data remains in place—for that user and their browser only.
